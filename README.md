# My first repository 
I'm RenÃ© Kunte and this is my git playground.

Remember: status, add, commit, push :clap:

## General information

Basis authentication using a password to Git is deprecated and will soon no longer work. Beginning August 13, 2021 GitHub will no longer accept account passwords when authenticating Git operations. GitHub recomments token-based authentication, but you may continue using SSH keys.

--> I'm familiar using SSH, so I'm staying with SSH :smile:
